    <article class="article-content">

        <p>
            A year ago, if someone questioned me about what consumption is, I would have given a simple answer and said
            that it is purchasing things. Shopping, clothing, phone data, Netflix, takeaway food, and basic items of
            daily use. I also felt that I was a very average consumer. I was not en-gaged in anything extreme. I wasn't
            constantly shopping. I was just living.

        </p>

        <p>
            Nonetheless, my scholarly studies about consumption have slowly changed my everyday life. It made me realize
            that consumption is not only a financial activity but also a social activity, a cultural habit, and a
            routine, as well as an affective activity. It organizes my time, form my at-tention, influence my relations,
            and even create my understanding of myself. This blog will look back on my routine activities: the use of
            phones and food habits, online shopping, socializ-ing activities, and show how these activities lead me to
            the position of consumer in contempo-rary society.
        </p>

        <h2>My Day, Framed by Consumption</h2>

        <p>
            I do not wake up thinking about anything, but I start my morning with a reflex: to grab my phone. Before my
            feet hit the floor, I'm already consuming: notifications, messages, headlines, reels. It feels passive,
            habitual, not like "real" consumption because I am not spending money. However, the discussion of digital
            platforms by Jarrett (2006) allowed for the reinterpretation of this ritual (pp. 107-108). I am consuming
            the attention, time, and data, and I am also generating as a compliant user in a system of more or less
            covert surveillance, much like eBay users who feel that they have autonomy but they are actually being
            guided by community norms and mechanisms of surveillance (Jarrett, 2006, p. 116). The platforms are
            empowering; I select what to press, but they are craftily manipulative in directing my behaviour. This is a
            choreographed freedom. This perception caused my first hour of the day to be different; it was no longer an
            hour of neutral downtime but an organised induction into a cycle of engagement where I am the audience and
            product.

        </p>

        <h2>The Moral Weight of a Meal </h2>

        <p>
            Should my phone habits display structural shaping, my food relationship displays a closer arena of identity.
            I would take a meal because I would be hungry, because it tastes good, and because it is affordable. My
            relationship with food is much more than sustenance, a place to negotiate identity and to negotiate
            morality, on a day-to-day basis. De Solier (2013) explains that food consumption is instilled in moralities
            of consumption where decisions indicate class, ethics, and selfhood (p. 108). This puts my own supermarket
            dilemma not only in the terms of thrift and quality, but as an enactment of cultural and moral location.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am in the supermarket, standing and deciding on two loaves of bread. One is a white loaf, which is cheap
            and mass-produced. The other one is a costly sourdough, which is promoted as artisanal and local. The choice
            feels heavy. In this decision, I am being a sort of “partial omni-vore” taste with my middlebrow preferences
            of authentic foods, and the lowbrow preferences for industrialized foods (De Solier, 2013, pp. 120-121).
            Omnivore is the moral self which con-sumes ethically as opposed to food snobs who reflect elitism in their
            consumption (De Solier, 2013, pp. 115, 143). Such selective openness is a sign of cosmopolitan identity, a
            respect to-wards diversity and what is good in both quality and morality (De Solier, 2013, pp. 115, 121).
        </p>

        <p>
            Therefore, my anxiety related to food is not frivolous, but it shows a more serious cultural code where
            consumption is a realm of everyday practice for self-moral development (De Solier, 2013, p. 109). By such
            decisions, I am not merely feeding myself, but building myself a self who will aspire to be educated and
            moral, and to work my way through what de Solier (2013) refers to as the immorality of distinction (p. 143).
        </p>

        <p>
            Moreover, I have never just considered shopping as an errand, whether online or otherwise, where the
            distinction between browsing and purchasing is very thin. Now I realise that these online environments are
            not merely selling products to me; they just organize my emotional re-ality. What starts as a quest to find
            something particular, a book, a charger, a pair of shoes, easi-ly develops into something different
            altogether. I am browsing through customised suggestions, lured by time-sensitive deals and the assurance of
            an enhanced version of my daily existence. During such times, shopping is not about what I need but how I
            feel bored, stressed, restless, or need a small, immediate satisfaction.
        </p>


        <p>
            Such an emotional habit, instead of a rational one, has become more evident to me by the con-tribution of
            such scholars as Roach et al. (2019), who suggest that consumer societies define well-being and satisfaction
            depends on consumption (pp. 12, 21). The deeper I consider, the eas-ier I see my own needs become distorted
            into what I think would be necessary. Would I use this other reusable water bottle, or am I purchasing an
            illusion of the organised, sustainable, put-together version of me? The digitalized markets are made to take
            advantage of such ambiguity, making consumption a coping strategy, as well as a recreational activity. Not
            only am I pur-chasing a product, but I am purchasing a moment of distraction, a hit of dopamine, or a moment
            of control.
        </p>


        <h2>Spaces of Fleeting Belonging</h2>

        <p>
            This self-reflection on the issue of choice was offset by the reading of Khorana (2019), who made me focus
            on the locations where consumption occurs (p.3). Their analysis of Indian gro-cery stores as locations of
            conviviality on transit appealed to me strongly, in my unfamiliar set-ting. My personal version was located
            in a small and standalone cafe close to the university.
        </p>


        <p>It is not just a coffee shop. The baristas are aware of my regular order. I know other regulars, the student
            with his huge textbooks, the writer who sits and writes. We do not talk much; we just nod at one another.
            The structure of the cafe, as provided by Khorana (2019), allowed me to view this cafe as not only a vendor
            but a social node where interactions are enacted and facili-tated (p. 2). My entry into this temporary
            society is my buying of a coffee. It is a small, bought object, a moment of rest and silent appreciation
            spread out over my week. This consumption is not the purchase of an object, but rather an entry-level into a
            sense of place and belonging that I was not aware I was in need of.

        </figure>
        </p>


        <h2>Rituals That Bind Us</h2>

        <p>
            My greatest intellectual change was the realization that consumption was the bond of my social existence. My
            habit of taking out and watching a movie with my housemates on a weekly basis was sheer entertainment. At
            this point, I understand it in the light of Collins (2005, as cited in Boström, 2021, p. 2) and his idea of
            interaction ritual chains. These rites of shared consumption cause emotional energy and collective
            effervescence (Boström, 2021, p. 2).<br>
            I would use his model on our Friday evening (Boström, 2021, p. 2):
        <ul style="padding-left: 50px;">
            <li><strong>Group Assembly: </strong> The three of us are sitting in our living room.</li>
            <li><strong>Barriers to Outsiders: </strong> Our secret customs.</li>
            <li><strong>Mutual Focus of Attention: </strong> The meal that was eaten, the movie that was watched.</li>
            <li><strong>Shared Mood: </strong> Relaxation, camaraderie, release.</li>
        </ul>


        <figure>
            <img src="assets/Figure4.jpg" alt="Labubu figurine" width="100px">
            <figcaption>
                Figure 4 Shared consumption is often how we stay close (Freepik, 2024)
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        </p>

        <p>
            The laughter, the arguing out what to have, the mutual fun, this is Durkheim's collective effer-vescence, as
            summarized by Boström (2021, p. 2). The revelation is that this beautiful bonding ritual is driven by
            consumption. This introduces a lot of tension that he brings to your attention: it is through the same
            rituals that hold my most intimate relationships together that are also in-separably connected to the cycles
            of spending.
        </p>


        <h2>The Cultural Capital in My Tastes</h2>

        <p>
            In addition to these material rituals, the readings had me accounting my non-material consump-tion: my
            taste. Noble and Ang (2018) who use Bourdieu's cultural capital to analyze ethnicity and cultural
            consumption taught me about the concept of cultural capital as knowledge and preferences that indicate
            belonging and status (p. 298). They use regional scales as an analytical tool to compare ethnic groups in
            Australia (e.g., Australian, US, Asian) (Noble & Ang, 2018, pp. 299-300).
            It was interesting to analyze my personal cultural diet. The history of my streaming is com-prised mostly of
            Chinese series. I have music that is nearly completely anglophone. I am shame-fully unaware of comparable
            Australian visual artists or directors, as the survey conducted by Noble and Ang (2018) anticipates (pp.
            302-303). This audit revealed to me that my consump-tion adds up to a certain kind of cultural capital,
            which is globalised, Chinese. This is not an apolitical favoritism; it puts me in a place. It makes it easy
            to converse with certain peers but not to be able to talk to others. That is why now I view my entertainment
            as not only leisure but as a constant and unconscious investment in a specific culture that forms my social
            horizons.
        </p>

        <h2>The Algorithmic Mirror</h2>

        <p>
            This has brought together all these threads of moral anxiety, social ritual, and cultural capital into the
            digital world, where I am most obviously a consumer. My feeds in social media are a hall of mirrors, which
            is a constructed form of me that has been constructed by my history of clicks. For example, recently, I was
            going through a tough time so my feed kept showing me sad poetry. Jarrett’s (2006) platform
            discipline/community mechanism can be used here as a more general platform logic (pp. 107-108), which means
            that this gives a reassuring feeling of be-longingness and lures me into a behavioural trap (Jarrett, 2006,
            p. 107).

        <figure>

        </figure>
        </p>

        <p>
            The algorithm, which has learnt my inclinations, insists on offering more of the same. It not on-ly sells me
            products but also sells me back a pre-existing identity. “Since you loved that one, you will love this one.”
            My feeling of independent choice is a falsehood channelled through a slender passage created by information
            of my own. I am buying a self that is already determined to be what I am by the system, confining my tastes
            and making me less adventurous. This is consistent with the concepts of "filter bubble” which was proposed
            by Pariser (2011, p. 1). The filter bubble is a concept suggesting that the search engine and the social
            media, and their rec-ommendation and personalisation algorithms, are the very cause of the polarisation of
            the socie-ty and ideology that many nations are going through today: we are no longer getting a balanced and
            healthy information diet (Pariser, 2011, pp. 20, 23) but only see the information that seems appealing to
            our already existing interests and that reaffirm our current worldview (Pariser, 2011, pp. 7, 10).

        <h2>Final Verdict: Reflective Living in the System</h2>

        <p>
            So, the academic study of consumption has demonstrated the role of consumption in my every-day life is a
            totalising and structural one. It is the tool with the help of which my time is struc-tured, my social
            relationships are established and sustained, my identity is shaped, and my be-longing is bargained. The
            instruments offered by the academic study helped me see the reality. It provided me with specific ideas to
            substitute the emotions of indeterminacy and ambiguity with knowledge. I did not get out of the consumer
            society. I remain the scrolling, choosing, buy-ing, and sharing person. I have now become a reflective
            consumer. This awareness does not give me complete freedom, and yet it gives me a better sense of clarity.
            It enables me to ap-proach the system not as an innocent user, but with my eyes open, to go through its
            currents with a more difficult-acquired, more questioning kind of agency.
